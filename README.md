# ArithmeticFormatter
The  function is a Python utility designed to format and optionally solve basic arithmetic problems. It processes up to five problems at a time, ensuring that they are properly structured with either addition or subtraction operators. This function is ideal for displaying arithmetic problems in a clean and readable format, making it particularly useful for educational purposes or demonstrations.
To maintain accuracy and clarity, the function includes several input validation checks. It ensures that the number of problems does not exceed the limit of five, all operators are either '+' or '-', and operands consist solely of digits. Additionally, it verifies that the numbers in each problem do not exceed four digits in length. If any of these conditions are violated, the function provides clear error messages to guide the user.
Once validated, the function formats each arithmetic problem into a visually aligned output. It separates the components into three distinct rows: the first operand, the operator with the second operand, and a row of dashes for separation. If requested, a fourth row displaying the computed answers is included. The spacing between problems ensures proper alignment, making the results easy to read and interpret.
The function also includes an optional parameter, , which determines whether the solutions are displayed. By setting this parameter to , the user can include the results of each arithmetic operation in the output.
